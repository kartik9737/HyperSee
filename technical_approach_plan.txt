Technical Approach Plan for Hyperspectral Image Processing Project


- Backend:
  - Flask app with endpoints for file upload (/upload), prediction (/predict), and metrics (/metrics).
  - AETransformer model loaded from saved state for inference.
  - File upload endpoint saves HSI and Ground Truth files, runs a processing pipeline.
  - Training script preprocesses data, trains AETransformer model, and saves it.
- Frontend:
  - React app with FileUpload component to upload HSI and GT files to backend.
  - ModelResults component displays accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
  - Frontend interacts with backend via REST API calls.
- Data Flow:
  - User uploads files via frontend.
  - Backend saves files, runs pipeline, performs inference.
  - Results sent back to frontend and displayed.

Plan:
1. Backend Architecture
   - Describe Flask app structure and endpoints.
   - Explain AETransformer model loading and usage.
   - Detail file upload handling and pipeline execution.
   - Mention metrics evaluation endpoint.

2. Model Training Pipeline
   - Explain dataset preprocessing and reshaping.
   - Describe AETransformer model architecture (input_dim, latent_dim).
   - Outline training process and saving model.

3. Frontend Architecture
   - Describe React components: FileUpload and ModelResults.
   - Explain file input handling and API calls.
   - Detail result display with tables for classification report and confusion matrix.

4. Data Flow and Interaction
   - Illustrate flow from user file upload to backend processing.
   - Show how results are returned and rendered in frontend.
